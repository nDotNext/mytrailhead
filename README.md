# Welcome to my reference repo

This is where I save the stuff I create on Trailhead for refreshers and reference. I use a Trailhead profile that is only used for re-taking lessons for the purpose of creating the reference code checked in here. 

You are welcome to use anything here, though be warned that doing so for Trailhead evaluations is a violation of their code of conduct.
